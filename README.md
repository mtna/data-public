This repository hosts data that is available through the Rich Data Services public server. Visit public.richdataservices.com to learn more about accessing this data through our free API and other tools. 

In the process of packaging the data for publication, we are commonly addressing various data quality issues surrounding the various data sources, such as:

- reshaping or reorganizing the data to be better suited for analytical purposes
- enhancing the data by adding variable/fields to faciliate linking and analysis
- renaming variables to standardized names to facilitate processing and understanding
- capturing metadata and documentation
- repackaging the data in open format

The repository holds the various tools we use to harvest and support the above tasks along with resulting new datasets.
